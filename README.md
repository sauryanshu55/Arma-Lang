# Typescript Template

This repository was built from a custom-built template for a console-based [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) program designed for editing in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
Below, we outline the contents of the template for your reference if you need to build your own Typescript project.

## Package Management

We use [NPM](https://npmjs.com) for package management.
The package is initialized with:

~~~console
$> npm init
~~~

With default values given for the `package.json` file that is created.
In particular, a few scripts/sub-commands are given so that building, testing, _etc._, can be run via `npm run`.
See `package.json` to see what these commands do.

Note that the template uses the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) license which is replicated in `LICENSE`.
We recommend that you change the license as needed.

## Typescript

The Typescript compiler is installed as a (local) npm development package via `npm`:

~~~console
$> npm install typescript --save-dev
~~~

Development packages are packages that only used during program development, not program execution.

`tsconfig.json` contains default options to the Typescript compiler, `tsc`.
In particular, we specify that source files are contained in the `/src` directory and output files are placed in the `/dist` directory.
See the [tsconfig refeence](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) for more information on these options.

## ESLint

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to lint our code.
When coupled with appropriate Visual Studio Code plugin, ESLint provides strong support to enforce style and healthy code practices during development.
We installed `eslint` via the `eslint/config` helper tool:

~~~console
$> npm init @eslint/config
~~~

Arbitrarily, we chose the [Javascript Standard](https://standardjs.com) style for ESLint to enforce.
Feel free to customize this style template or choose a different style altogether.
`.eslintrc.js` contains these settings and the [ESLint user guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/) provides a comprehensive reference for the file.

## Jest

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as a testing framework for Typescript projects.
There are many such frameworks available; we choose Jest both because of its popularity and its ease of setup and use.

~~~console
$> npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest
$> npx ts-jest config:init
~~~

The last command adds a Jest configuration file, `jest.config.js`, to the project.

## Devcontainer Configuration

The `/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file configures the runtime instance created when the project is loaded within a Github Codespace.
The file is the default configuration file provided by Microsoft in its [Node.js container template](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-node) with appropriate modifications for these kinds of projects.

Notably, if this project is run in a local version of Visual Studio Code, we recommend installing the following plugins to manage your work:

+   [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
+   [Github Classroom](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.classroom)

## Git Configuration

`.gitignore` is pre-populated so that Git ignores all build files generated by the project.
